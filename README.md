# HECML-Windmill-Competition-Demo

Two people can walk up to the demo station and compete by blowing on two fans. The idea of the game is to see who can generate the highest voltage reading by blowing on two fans. Note that young kids tend to get dizzy if they blow too hard. Thus they should not try to compete twice within a given period time to prevent hyperventalation. 

Run the python script, and a countdown timer will start. After the timer completes, the script will display the winner.
